The code will display a new quote each time you click a button.
Save the code below in an HTML file (e.g., quote_generator.html) and open it in your web browser to see the random quote generator

In this example, we create a simple random quote generator. The quotes are stored in an array, and each time the button is clicked, a random quote is displayed along with its author.
Feel free to customize the quotes array with your favorite quotes or add more features to the generator, such as styling improvements or sharing the quotes on social media. Have fun with your new random quote generator!
